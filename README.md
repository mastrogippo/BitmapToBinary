BitmapToBinary
=========

Generates a binary file from a list of bitmaps. It is written to optimize the transfer of data from MCU memory to Nokia 5110/3310 displays based on the PCD8544 controller.

It was just a quick fix, there is still a whole lot to fix and improve. Just take it as an example on how to handle single pixels in bitmaps in C#.

Usage
=========

Put bmp files on the "bmp" folder in the same folder as the .exe. Add files to convert from the left list to the right one.

ToDo
=========

Create an index of added files.
